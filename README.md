Made for a raspberry pi running raspbian (or other linux distro), some kind of camera, a soil moisture sensor using a ADC, two relays (you could easily replace these with transistors) 

There are lots of test files for testing GPIO pins and peripheral functionality.

You can run EZStart.sh (make sure to change perms to make it executable) and it will run the whole system automatically and open the UI.

No further modifications/updates are expected to me made
